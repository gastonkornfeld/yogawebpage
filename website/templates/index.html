    <p>
      
      Build a "comprehensive YOGA routine" that motivates you to maintain it over time
    </p>
    <p>In each of them you will find: a calendar, a guide and video, audio and pdf material.
      You have the option of doing each one of them separately or purchasing the 3 #yoguiroutines together,
      for a complete accompaniment plan
    </p>
    <p>Each of my yogi routines are a different way of
      achieve well-being that starts from self-knowledge, acceptance and love for yourself.
      But with an organized method with simple and practical steps so that you can soon feel the difference and
      you feel motivated to maintain it over time.
